# Disease Diagnosis and Prediction Using Symptoms-Based Clustering

## Overview 🩺✨

This repository contains a machine learning-based system for disease diagnosis and prediction using symptoms. By clustering symptoms into meaningful groups, this project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnostics. The project leverages unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to identify patterns in symptom data and predict diseases effectively.

---

## Features 🚀

- **Symptoms Clustering**: Groups similar symptoms to identify patterns in patient data.
- **Disease Prediction**: Uses clustering and classification models to predict potential diseases.
- **Customizable Dataset**: Works with various symptom-disease datasets.
- **Visualizations**: Displays clustering patterns and prediction outcomes using advanced plotting libraries.
- **Scalable Framework**: Easily extensible to new symptoms or disease categories.

   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. (Optional) Add your dataset to the `data` folder.

---

## Usage 🏃‍♂️

1. Preprocess the data:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

2. Train the clustering model:
   ```bash
   python train_clustering.py
   ```

3. Predict diseases based on new symptoms:
   ```bash

## Dataset 📊

The project uses a custom or publicly available symptom-disease dataset. Each row in the dataset represents:

- **Symptoms**: Features (columns) indicating the presence/absence of symptoms.
- **Disease**: The target label indicating the disease.

Example format:
| Symptom 1 | Symptom 2 | Symptom 3 | ... | Disease |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----|---------|
| 1         | 0         | 1         | ... | Flu     |
| 0         | 1         | 1         | ... | Allergy |

## How It Works ⚙️

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Cleans missing values.
   - Encodes categorical data.
   - Scales numerical features.

2. **Symptoms Clustering**:
   - Applies clustering algorithms to group similar symptoms.
   - Identifies common symptom patterns across the dataset.

3. **Disease Prediction**:
   - Trains classification models on clustered data.
   - Predicts diseases based on symptom inputs.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
   - Visualizations: Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve.

---

## Results 📈

- **Clustering Performance**:
  - Optimal clusters determined using the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score.
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of **X%** using Random Forest (replace X with your result).
- **Insights**: Common symptom clusters revealed significant relationships between diseases.

---

## Future Improvements 🌟

- Integrate NLP for analyzing free-text symptom descriptions.
- Add real-time disease prediction via API or web app.
- Expand the dataset to include rare diseases.
- Incorporate time-series symptom progression analysis.
